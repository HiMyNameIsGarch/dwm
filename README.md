# Garch's build of dwm
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

If you want to see my scripts that I used in some of the bindings, check out [this](https://github.com/HiMyNameIsGarch/dotfiles/tree/main/.local/bin).
## Bar
I use dwmblocks as my bar and you can find it [here](https://github.com/HiMyNameIsGarch/dwmblocks).
## Patches
 - [Actual fullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/actualfullscreen/) - Toggle fullscreen for a window.
 - [Autostart](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/) - Start some programs when dwm starts.
 - [Bar height](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/bar_height/) - Change default value for bar height.
 - [Fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/) - Add gaps between windows.
 - [No border](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/noborder/) - When a single window is visible, do not show the border.
 - [Pertag](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag/) - Keep some values per tag.
 - [Warp](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/warp/) - When switching a window, put the cursor in the middle of it.
